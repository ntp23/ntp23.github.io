        <h2>Gather Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Banana pancakes are super easy to make and only need a few ingredients so open your pantry/fridge grab some bananas, eggs, coconut flakes (optional), a cooking oil of your choice, maple syrup, and then you're ready to go!</p>
    </li>
    <li id="step1">
      <h2>Mash the Banana</h2>
      <p>Using a fork, mash bananas into a medium bowl until the banana has a smooth batter-like consisitency. </p>
  </li>
  <li id="step3">
    <h2>Add Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Once your bananas are all mashed up, add 2 eggs to finish off the batter. It will be very liquidy! Don't worry, that's normal. For those of you who like fluffier pancakes, add 1 tablespoon of coconut flakes which will thicken the batter and give pancakes a fluffier consisitency. </p>
</li>
<li id="step4">
  <h2>Prep the Pan and Start Cooking</h2>
  <p>Heat a pan with the cooking oil of your choice on medium heat, and then drop some batter into the pan and start cooking. Cook for about a minute or until  the batter starts bubbling and the edges look brown. Then flip the pancake and cook it again.  </p>
</li>
<li id="step5">
  <h2>Top it Off and Serve</h2>
  <p>Once your pancakes are cooked pour some maple syrup on your banana pancake stack and enjoy! </p>
</li>
