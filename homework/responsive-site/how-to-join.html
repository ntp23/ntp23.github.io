    <h1 id="maintitle"> How to Join</h1>
    <div class="left">
      Because we want everyone joining Greek Life to find the sorority where they feel the most at home, Panhellenic at the University of Miami does not allow anyone to rush a specific sorority.
      <br> <br>
      All girls interested in joining must register for recruitment on Panhellenic's website and go through the formal process of meeting girls in all six sororities before choosing the one they want.
