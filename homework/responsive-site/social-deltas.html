    <p>Work Hard. Play Harder. While our sisters all know that school comes first, we still love to go out and have fun. Therefore, out chapter has weekly closed events with UM's fraternities, along with crush parties, date dashes, formal, semi-formal, and other sisterhood events</p>

<div class="L">
<b>Closed Events & Mixers</b>
<p>Our social chair works hard to plan weekly events with UMiami's fraternities. These events include Saturday pool parties, beach days, mid-week frat parties, and Grove pregames <br><br> We also have numerous mixers throughout the semester, which is when we pair with a frat to throw a themed event at an off-campus venue. The frats we mix with most are Phi Delt, Beta, and AEPI.</p>
</div>
    <div class="M">
       <b>Date Functions</b>
       <p>Every semester, our chapter has a variety of themed Crush Parties, as well as a Formal/Semi-formal event. To attend, members must be in good standing of both the chapter and the University. <br> <br>Previous crush party themes have been Draft a Date (Army), Great Gatsby, Liv on a Thursday, Angels vs Devils, Whiteout, Blackout, and Hometown Throwdown </p>
</div>
<div class="R">
  <b>Sisterhood Events</b><p>Our chapter also hosts numerous Deltas Only events to give our sisters time to hang out and get to know each other. We also use these events as an opportunity to film clips for our recruitment video.<br><br>Previous Deltas Only events include: brunch at the Mondrian Hotel, Hot Yoga, Beach day, Kayaking at Virginia Key, Movie night in the suite, Kaamps workout class, Great Escape Room, etc.
