       <p>What is St. Jude's?
       <br><br>
     St. Jude Children's Research hospital is a pediatric treatment and research facility for children with cancer and other deadly diseases. Founded in 1962 by Danny Thomas, St. Jude was created to allow families to focus on their child's health without worrying about paying for treatment, hotel rooms, food, etc. It costs $1.8 million per day to keep the hospital running however patients and families will never receive a bill. No child is ever denied treatment and the hospital has a 94% survival rate. In honor of Tri Delta becoming the largest single fundraising committee in 2014, St. Jude built a short-term housing facility and named it Tri Delta Place.
